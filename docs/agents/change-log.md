# Agent Docs Change Log

## 2026-02-13 — Runner-CLI phase 1 planning
- Added `runner-cli-phase1-plan.md` to define control-plane integration scope.
- Locked phase 1 to dispatch/run-query adapters with preserved `gh`/REST fallback behavior.
- Documented acceptance criteria, validation gates, and non-goals to prevent schema-breaking drift.

## 2026-02-13 — Phase B backfill from run evidence
- Updated `quickstart.md` with 3-run outcomes table and canonical release-plan references.
- Updated `release-gates.md` with explicit evidence backfill table for runs:
  - 22002791381
  - 22004004032
  - 22005219153
- Updated `ci-catalog.md` with recent failure evidence and active branch context.

- 22005219153 remains non-terminal and missing packed library artifacts at last validation snapshot.
